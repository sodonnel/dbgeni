Think about the migration workflow and the dates etc that are being set

Logger (basic logger implemeneted. May need expanded as requirements develop)

SQLite doesn't seem to log the command or error to the logfile when it encounters an error. Just writes an empty log file

Migration that fails to rollback makes it look like the migration failed has not been applied. Perhaps correct as the code is in limbo land, but not sure what the best thing to do with it is.
