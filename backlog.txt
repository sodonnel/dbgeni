Maybe more tests for base apply and rollback until
Better Logging
----------------------------------------------
Milestones
Prompt for password if missing and needed - look at environment.rb __get_param. Use this to prompt for password if it is needed. Also, make sure sqlite related things don't ask for it, as they don't need it.
----------------------------------------------
Parameters in SQL scripts
Global Parameters
----------------------------------------------
Refactor Migrators to have a parent class to inherit methods from
MYSQL support
----------------------------------------------
DAT files
Validation hooks
Validation scripts




Think about the migration workflow and the dates etc that are being set

Migration that fails to rollback makes it look like the migration failed has not been applied. 
Perhaps correct as the code is in limbo land, but not sure what the best thing to do with it is.

Missing migration for rollback, what happens and what about force?
  If a migration file is missing, it will error when rollback is applied.
  If force is used, it will still push on with the next rollback.

Applying lots of code or migration files is slow due to a new SQLPLUS connection 
each time. Think about how to batch many together (especially procedures).
