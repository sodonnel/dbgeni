Maybe more tests for base apply and rollback until
Better Logging
----------------------------------------------
Milestones - add CLI tests for the migrations apply/rollback milestone. Add Milestone CLI and tests.
Extract first error message for migrations and display (and aborted code errors due to insufficient privs)
Something strange happens when a code apply aborts - the correct error etc is not presented.
----------------------------------------------
Refactor Migrators to have a parent class to inherit methods from
MYSQL support
----------------------------------------------
Parameters in SQL scripts
Global Parameters
----------------------------------------------
DAT files
Validation hooks
Validation scripts
Make password be hidden when typing it in from a prompt
Make sure something is typed in (ie not blank) or reprompt
Grants for procedures - how to do them without two commands
Bad NLS_LANG setting causes a very strange error.




Think about the migration workflow and the dates etc that are being set

Migration that fails to rollback makes it look like the migration failed has not been applied. 
Perhaps correct as the code is in limbo land, but not sure what the best thing to do with it is.

Missing migration for rollback, what happens and what about force?
  If a migration file is missing, it will error when rollback is applied.
  If force is used, it will still push on with the next rollback.

Applying lots of code or migration files is slow due to a new SQLPLUS connection 
each time. Think about how to batch many together (especially procedures).
