Grants for procedures - how to do them without two commands
Bad NLS_LANG setting causes a very strange error.
Tests to ensure error message is extracted for (1) migration error (2) rollback error (3) code compile (4) code blow up (at least partially tested)




Think about the migration workflow and the dates etc that are being set

Migration that fails to rollback makes it look like the migration failed has not been applied. 
Perhaps correct as the code is in limbo land, but not sure what the best thing to do with it is.

Missing migration for rollback, what happens and what about force?
  If a migration file is missing, it will error when rollback is applied.
  If force is used, it will still push on with the next rollback.

Applying lots of code or migration files is slow due to a new SQLPLUS connection 
each time. Think about how to batch many together (especially procedures).
