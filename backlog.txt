Think about the migration workflow and the dates etc that are being set

Migration that fails to rollback makes it look like the migration failed has not been applied. Perhaps correct as the code is in limbo land, but not sure what the best thing to do with it is.


set ORACLE_HOME=C:\app\sodonnell\product\11.2.0\dbhome_1


Missing migration for rollback, what happens and what about force?
  If a migration file is missing, it will error when rollback is applied.
  If force is used, it will still push on with the next rollback.
