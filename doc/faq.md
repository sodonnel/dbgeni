## How much does dbgeni cost?<a id="1"></a>

While dbgeni is in beta it is free. It might always remain free, or it might not, I haven't decided yet. I have been considering making it free for open source databases, but charge for commercial databases.

## Is dbgeni opensource?<a id="2"></a>

Until I decide whether or not to charge for dbgeni it will remain closed source. As it is distributed as a Ruby gem, there is nothing I can do to stop you viewing the source!
