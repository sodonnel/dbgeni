# Why?

Having worked as an Oracle database application designer for about 10 years, I became increasingly frustrated with how many database professionals generate release scripts by comparing schemas and rarely use version control correctly. This led to large time overheads when creating releases and error prone release packages.

Inspired by how [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) used migrations, I put a database-change-using-migrations approach in place at my then day job for a team of about 150 database developers, and it worked very well.

Further inspired by this success, I started the dbgeni project.
